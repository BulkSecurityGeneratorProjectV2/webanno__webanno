= UIMA CAS XMI

The probably most commonly used formats supported by the Apache UIMA framework is UIMA CAS XMI.
It is able to capture all the information contained in the CAS. This is the de-facto standard for exchanging data in the UIMA world. Most UIMA-related tools support it.

The XMI format does not include type system information. When exporting files in the XMI format, a ZIP file is created for each document which contains the XMI file itself as well as an XML file containing the type system.
