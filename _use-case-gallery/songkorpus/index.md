Systematically compiled collections of written and spoken texts form the most important empirical
basis for linguistically motivated research on human language. Extensive data resources exist for
standard and close-to-standard language varieties, supplemented by special corpora covering specific
language situations and fields of application. Noteworthy against this background is the lack of
scientifically valid, sustainably utilizable digital collections of pop lyrics, especially for the
German language. Just as pop music has evolved from an originally youth cultural phenomenon in the
nineteen-fifties and -sixties into an integral part of modern culture, its textual content has
become omnipresent in the realm of everyday language. But unfortunately, song lyrics play a rather
subordinate role in empirical language research so far - most likely due to the absence of
scientifically valid, sustainable resources. Songkorpus (see the website at songkorpus.de) fills
this gap, and provides the first multiply annotated corpus of German lyrics as a basis for
multidisciplinary research. Besides linguistics and literature, benefiting research areas can be
located in the broad spectrum of language didactics, musicology, (socio)cultural or media studies. 

Our stratification objective is the comprehensive coverage of complete works, and not just the
arbitrary compilation of some lyrics’ verses or phrases. Our corpus archives represent the works
of selected singers/songwriters or bands who have kindly agreed to provide their lyrics for
non-commercial, scientific research, spanning a period of about five decades. An additional
archive includes German-language songs ranked in the official German Top 100 single charts since
1970, considering CD sales, internet downloads, and streaming platforms.

In order to cover various levels of granularity and to ensure interoperability, all lyrics are
formatted using structural descriptions according to TEI P5. The corpus processing takes place as
an interplay between automated annotation runs and manual post-editing. Results of the CLARIN
infrastructure component WebLicht are imported into the web-based curation platform WebAnno. This
allows the application of an extended POS tagset, the introduction of new classes for named
entities, and special layers for neologisms and occasionalisms. Finally, a chain layer for the
linking of rhyming words is added. All annotations – multiple classes, multiple annotators – are
subject to inter-annotator reliability, using Fleiss’ kappa.
